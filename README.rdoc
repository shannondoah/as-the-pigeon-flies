== As the Pigeon Flies

Simple app just to test out how Twilio works and integrates with Rails. Also experimented with ruby threads and a little bit of front end work. Nothing exceptionally robust but a fun way to pass a morning and maybe troll a few friends.

The user enters a message into a form, and the text is sent to the recipient phone number at a rate of one letter per minute. For added trolling fun, send to a landline.

Versions used:

* Ruby 2.0

* Rails 4.2

* Twilio-Ruby 4.2.1
